                <p className='text-gray-800'>I specialize in building modern, scalable, and user-friendly web applications using cutting-edge technologies. With experience in Next.js for frontend development, Tailwind CSS for clean and responsive UI design, and Firebase & MongoDB for backend services and database management, I bridge the gap between design and functionality seamlessly.

                    I love transforming ideas into reality through clean and efficient code, ensuring exceptional user experience and performance.
                    When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, or enjoying a good cup of coffee.

                    Letâ€™s connect and build something amazing together! ðŸš€
